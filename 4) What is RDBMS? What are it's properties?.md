RDBMS - Relational Database Management System maintains data and indices in the form of table. 
The relationships maybe created accross and among the data and tables. 
In a relational database, relationships between data items are expressed through tables.
The interdependencies among these tables are expressed by data values rather than pointers. This provides higher degree of data independence.
RDBMS has the capability to recombine data items from data files, thus providing a powerful tool for data usage.
